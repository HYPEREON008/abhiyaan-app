Q5. Establishing Connections

Use the package called Turtlesim and do the following questions:

1\. Write a ROS 2 Node to draw a circle using Turtlesim

2\. Write a ROS 2 Node to draw a square using Turtlesim

Bored of turtles? Even Madhav hates them (jk)

Now as you have understood how Nodes work, let us do this totally FUN question.

Objective

The goal of this assignment is to implement a distributed monitoring system using three

ROS 2 nodes to track a simulated entity’s position, compute its real-time speed, and

issue warnings when a defined speed limit is exceeded.
